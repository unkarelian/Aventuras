# Prompts

Where prompt text comes from, and the order it is assembled in.

## Prompt Packs and Template Resolution

Every prompt the app sends is a Liquid template. The code baseline lives in
`src/lib/services/prompts/templates/`; at runtime templates are served from a **prompt pack** stored in
SQLite, which the user can edit in the Vault.

Resolution order (`ContextBuilder.resolveTemplate`), first hit wins:

1. the active pack's own row
2. `default-pack`'s row
3. the compiled-in baseline in `PROMPT_TEMPLATES`

A template has a system half (`content`) and an optional user half (`userContent`). The user half is
stored under the id `<template-id>-user`, and `ContextBuilder.render(id)` returns `{ system, user }` by
resolving both. A service that destructures only `system` silently drops the user half — every service
except the two whose templates deliberately have none.

### Which pack is "the active pack"

There is no ambient one. A pack is chosen per story (`stories.pack_id`), and the wizard holds its own
selection until the story it is building exists. A `ContextBuilder` therefore has to be told, and there
are three ways to build one:

| Factory                          | Use when                                                             |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ContextBuilder.forStory(id)`    | the template also wants story variables (mode, pov, protagonist, …)   |
| `ContextBuilder.forPack(id)`     | the service populates its own context and needs only the pack         |
| `ContextBuilder.forPackId(pack)` | the wizard and the Vault, which hold a pack but no story              |

`forPack` skips `forStory`'s entity loads but still resolves pack variables and per-story overrides, so
a user's custom variable works in any template. Neither factory throws: several callers build their
context outside the `try` guarding the model call, and losing a customization must not cost the turn.

**The `storyId` argument is required, never optional.** `undefined` is a legitimate value — outside a
story — but it has to be passed. This is the whole defence: an optional trailing `storyId?: string` type-
checks when omitted, and every prompt rendered without one silently resolves against `default-pack` while
the user's chosen pack sits unused. Nothing in the output says so. Where the parameter would otherwise
land behind an optional one, it goes **first** rather than becoming optional itself.

Image style templates and the interactive-lorebook tool template are external — raw text spliced into a
prompt, never rendered through Liquid — but they live in a pack, so they call `resolveTemplate` directly
rather than reimplementing the chain: `resolveStylePrompt(storyId, styleId)` /
`resolveStylePromptForPack(packId, styleId)` in `services/ai/image/stylePrompt.ts` wrap it, adding only
the built-in style for the case where the id resolves to nothing. A second chain would drift, and did:
skipping the code baseline meant a pack missing `image-style-photorealistic` silently rendered soft
anime. The Vault is global and has no story, so it resolves against `default-pack` by design.

`PackService.initialize()` does two distinct things on startup, and they are not interchangeable:

- **`refreshDefaultPackTemplates`** updates `default-pack` when the code baseline changes, so shipped
  prompt improvements reach existing installs.
- **`backfillMissingTemplates`** inserts templates _added_ by a later app version into every pack, so the
  user has something to open in the editor. Custom packs are never otherwise auto-updated.

**Never overwrite a user's edit.** `pack_templates` carries both `content_hash` (the hash of what is
stored) and `baseline_hash` (the hash of the baseline it was last written from). They are equal while a
template is untouched and diverge the moment someone saves an edit, and only `PackService` writes
`baseline_hash` — `database.setPackTemplateContent` takes a required `isBaseline` flag to force the
distinction at every call site. The refresh skips any row where the two differ. Comparing the stored
content's own hash against the baseline instead, as it once did, reads every user edit as a stale default
and reverts it on the next app start.

### Three States, and Refreshing the Built-in Pack

The two hashes carry more than "edited or not". Comparing `baseline_hash` against the hash of what the code
ships **now** separates a customisation from a template that has genuinely fallen behind:

| | `content_hash` vs `baseline_hash` | `baseline_hash` vs hash of shipped text | |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Current** | equal | equal | the startup refresh keeps it up to date |
| **Customised** | differ | equal | the user edited it; nothing newer has shipped |
| **Behind** | differ | differ | the user edited it **and** newer text has shipped |

`classifyTemplate` in `services/packs/staleness.ts` is the predicate; both halves are needed, since
`isUntouched` alone counts customisations as stale and the baseline comparison alone flags every row of a
pack whose baseline was never the shipped text. It survives edit → ship → edit, because only a baseline
write moves `baseline_hash` and the refresh never touches an edited row. A row the editor *created*
carries `baseline_hash = ''` and so reads as behind — a known false positive, which the UI mitigates by
naming every affected template before anything is written.

Pack Settings reports both counts for `default-pack` and offers `packService.refreshTemplates`, at one of
two scopes. **The classification informs the user; it does not decide for them.** Prompts reference shared
conventions and a user's edits usually span several templates written to agree with each other, so
replacing only the subset that happens to be behind can leave half a coherent set of edits sitting against
the other half's replacement. `'behind'` takes only what the app has changed since; `'edited'` takes every
edit, which is what restores coherence and is also the deliberate revert-to-stock the app otherwise lacks.

Refreshed rows are written as their own baseline, so they resume receiving shipped updates — the same
effect the per-template "Reset to default" button has.

**Only `default-pack` can be refreshed.** A custom pack's baseline is not the shipped text: for an imported
pack it is the file its author wrote, so taking "the shipped version" there would replace their prompts
with Aventuras' own. (The per-template reset button predates this and *is* offered on every pack, imported
ones included.)

### Updating a Pack From a File

A custom pack is otherwise frozen at the baseline it was created from, so replacing its contents with a
newer `.prompt.json` is the only way to update one. `importExportService.updatePackFromFile` does that
**in place**: the `preset_packs` row is updated, never deleted, and only `pack_templates` and
`pack_variables` are cleared and rewritten, in one transaction (`database.replacePackContents`).

What that preserves is the point of doing it this way:

- **The pack id**, so `stories.pack_id` still resolves. It is `ON DELETE RESTRICT`, so a delete-and-recreate
  could not run at all while a story used the pack.
- **Runtime variable definitions.** `pack_runtime_variables` is `ON DELETE CASCADE`; dropping the pack row
  takes the definitions with it while entity `metadata.runtimeVars` keeps holding values keyed by their
  ids — unreachable and unfixable. The export format carries no runtime variables, so a file that says
  nothing about them changes nothing about them.
- **The pack's name**, which is the user's label. Description and author come from the file.
- **A story's `custom_variable_values`**, which are keyed by variable name, so answers survive wherever the
  file keeps a name.

What it discards is every edit to that pack's templates — which is the operation, and why the confirmation
counts them first. That count uses `isUntouched` (did the user change this?), not
`getModifiedTemplates` (does this differ from what ships today?); the second also flags templates the user
never touched but a later app version has improved.

Rows are written with `isBaseline: true` — the file *is* this pack's baseline. **That is why `default-pack`
is excluded**: marking every row as its own baseline makes them all read as untouched, so
`refreshDefaultPackTemplates` would decide the shipped prompts had changed and overwrite the whole import
on the next launch. Importing over the built-in pack would appear to work until the next restart.

Templates the file omits are gone from the pack; resolution falls through to `default-pack` and then the
code baseline, and `backfillMissingTemplates` re-inserts them on the next start. This is deliberate — an
updated pack should match what a fresh import of the same file produces, not carry ghosts of its previous
self.

Importing a file always creates a *new* pack. A name collision offers a copy or a cancel, never an
overwrite: replacing a pack is reached from that pack, not from a name that happens to match.

### Exporting a Pack as a Directory

A pack is also readable and writable as a directory of Markdown files — one per stored row, `pack.yaml` at
the root for metadata and custom variables, generated reference material under `_reference/`. Desktop only:
`tauri-plugin-dialog`'s folder picker is `FolderPickerNotImplemented` on mobile. On desktop the picked
folder reaches `fs_scope.allow_directory`, so the capability's `$APPDATA`/`$TEMP` scope is not a constraint
and the whole thing is plain `plugin-fs` from TypeScript.

**The filename is the identity; the folder is presentation.** `<group>/<id>.md`, where the group comes from
`TEMPLATE_GROUP_MAP` — which is code, and changes between releases. Were the path the identity, a template
the app regroups would read as a delete plus an add of a file the user may also have edited. As a stem it is
a rename, which git detects. Import ignores the folder entirely, so two files sharing a name anywhere in the
tree are refused rather than resolved.

Import reads `pack.yaml` and `.md` files inside folders. Root `.md` files and `_`-prefixed folders are
ignored silently, which is what lets a user's `README.md`, their notes, and the generated reference share
one tree with no manifest saying which is which. Export writes into that tree, and prunes template files and
reference material it did not write — but only in a directory already carrying a `pack.yaml`, and never a
root file it does not own.

Two exports of unchanged content must be byte-identical or git cannot merge them, which is the whole point.
Hence LF endings, one trailing newline, fixed key order in `pack.yaml`, variables sorted by `sortOrder` then
name, and **no timestamp** — a value that moves between two exports of the same pack conflicts on every
merge and says nothing the commit does not.

`_reference/template-status.md` names the templates carrying an edit, and speaks a different language per
source. For `default-pack` it uses `classifyTemplate`'s three states, because there the baseline *is* the
shipped text; those rows are what would otherwise ride silently into a merge base. For a custom pack it uses
`isUntouched` alone — a shipped comparison there would flag every row of a pack whose baseline was never the
shipped text — and names what the next replace destroys.

### Why the Baseline Lives in Git

`baseline_hash` is a single-slot approximation of a three-way merge for one pack. The workflow the directory
format exists for does the merge properly: export the shipped baseline on each release onto an upstream
branch, merge it into the branch carrying your own edits, review the result as a diff, import that into a
custom pack. `base` is the previous shipped-baseline export, `theirs` the new one, `ours` the edited tree.

The app therefore contributes two things and models none of the rest: a `theirs` no edit can reach, and an
import that does not lie about what it wrote. **The shipped-baseline export is a separate action** — it
reads `PROMPT_TEMPLATES`, not a pack's rows, so one in-app edit to `default-pack` cannot poison the merge
base. It lives beside `refreshTemplates` in the built-in pack's Pack Settings, whose subject is already the
text the app ships rather than the pack it renders under.

A directory import writes rows with `isBaseline: true`, as `updatePackFromFile` does, and for the same
reason: the file *is* the pack's baseline, the user's edits live in git. The alternative reads every row as
edited, so `summarizeUpdate` would warn that ~80 edits are about to be discarded on every single import —
and a warning that always fires stops being read. The built-in pack stays excluded as an import target for
the reason it already is.

## Prompt Ordering and Prefix Caching

Inference servers reuse the KV cache for the longest prefix a request shares with the previous one, and
reprocess everything after the first differing token. **Prompt templates are therefore ordered by how
often each block changes, not by how the prompt reads.** Stable material first, volatile material last.

This is not cosmetic. On a 40-chapter story the narrator prompt is ~156k characters, of which the chapter
summaries are ~54k and byte-identical between turns; with the per-turn world state in front of them, the
reusable prefix was 3.6% of the request. The same inversion cost the retrieval agent, the classifier and
both Tier 3 selections their entire prefix — two consecutive classifier calls shared 201 characters of
40,000.

Two consequences worth knowing before editing a template:

- The system message is sent before the user message, so a divergence inside the system prompt
  invalidates the user message too, however stable that is on its own.
- Instructions belong at the end anyway, which is also where the volatile content wants to be. The two
  goals rarely conflict.

`src/lib/services/prompts/templates/narrative.test.ts` pins this ordering, since reversing it breaks
nothing visible — it just quietly costs thousands of tokens of reprocessing every turn.

**Ordering is necessary but not sufficient, and on some servers it buys nothing.** "Reuse the
longest shared prefix" is the ideal; a real server may only reuse a prefix it can reach without
_truncating_ a cached state. Measured against `llama-server` with a sliding-window model (Gemma 4):
a prompt that extends a cached one reuses everything, a prompt that diverges a few thousand tokens
from the end still reuses everything, and a prompt that diverges ~8k tokens or more from the end
reuses **nothing at all** — the whole request is reprocessed. `--ctx-checkpoints` /
`--checkpoint-min-step` did not move that boundary.

The consequence for template authoring is stronger than "stable first": the volatile block has to be
_near the end_, not merely after the stable one. The narrator prompt currently diverges at
`</story_history>` — about 37% in — because `[CURRENT STORY TIME]` and the per-turn world state sit
in front of ~30k characters of otherwise byte-identical lorebook and scene material. That 37% is
what the ordering bought; on a truncation-averse server it is also 37% too early to be worth
anything.
