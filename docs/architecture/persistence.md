# Persistence

The database, the native layer that moves bytes around it, and the settings blob.

## Database and Migrations

- **Engine**: SQLite, accessed from the frontend via `@tauri-apps/plugin-sql` and from the Rust side via
  `sqlx` (see `tauri-plugin-sql` / `sqlx` in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`).
- **Location**: `tauri-plugin-sql` resolves `sqlite:aventura.db` against Tauri's **app config dir**
  (`~/.config/<bundle-id>` on Linux), not the app data dir. Rust code that opens the same file
  directly — `backup.rs`, `avt_import.rs`, and the migration checksum patch in `lib.rs` — must use
  `app_config_dir()` for the same reason, or it silently operates on a database that does not exist.
- **Migrations**: Sequentially numbered SQL files in `src-tauri/migrations/` (e.g. `001_initial.sql`,
  `002_chapters_checkpoints.sql`, ...), applied in order at startup.
- **Line endings matter**: `sqlx` checksums each migration file to detect drift, so migrations must use LF
  line endings on every platform. This is enforced by `.gitattributes` (forces `eol=lf` for
  `src-tauri/migrations/*.sql`) and by the `check_migrations` pre-commit hook below.
- **Never `BEGIN` from the frontend**: `tauri-plugin-sql` runs every `execute()` on an arbitrary
  connection from an `sqlx` pool, and exposes no way to pin one (`Pool::connect` in the plugin's
  `wrapper.rs` takes no options). A `BEGIN` therefore opens a transaction that the following statements
  never join and the `COMMIT` never finds, while the connection that opened it keeps a write lock that
  turns every later write into `database is locked`. Prefer one statement that is atomic by itself — a
  multi-row `INSERT`, an `UPDATE ... WHERE`. When several statements must land together, send them as a
  batch to **`database.transaction()`**, which hands them to the `db_transaction` Rust command
  (`src-tauri/src/db_tx.rs`): one connection, a real transaction, rollback on the first error, and the
  rows affected by each statement back. Values travel as bound parameters — never interpolate into the
  SQL. Keep the SQL in `database.ts` rather than in components, as
  `deleteRuntimeVariableEverywhere` and its neighbours do.
- **A read the batch depends on belongs inside it**, as a subquery. The runtime-variable writes reach
  their rows through `SELECT id FROM stories WHERE pack_id = ?` rather than resolving the ids first:
  the batch is atomic, the round trip that fed it was not, and a story assigned to the pack in
  between kept a variable the pack no longer had.
- **`stories.retry_state` is a JSON blob**, so fields are added inside it rather than by migration —
  `embeddedImageIds`, `characterSnapshots`, `timeTracker` and now `branchId` all arrived that way.
  `branchId` names the branch the snapshot was taken on, and a restore onto any other branch is
  refused. State written before it was recorded cannot be attributed to a branch, and is **discarded
  on load** rather than assumed to belong to main: the readers most likely to hold such state are
  precisely those whose last generation was on a branch, and restoring one branch's snapshot onto
  another deletes rows there. The cost is one lost cross-session retry per story; the next
  generation records an attributable snapshot and the ability returns.

## The Native (Rust) Layer

Most of the app is TypeScript; Rust owns the jobs that would otherwise blow up the WebView heap —
which on Android is a hard cap, not a soft one. The rule throughout is **JS owns the structure,
Rust owns the bytes**: only small parameters (paths, ids) cross the IPC bridge.

- **`backup.rs`** — database backup/restore and image export. Payloads are streamed file-to-file or
  DB-to-file and never enter the JS heap.
- **`avt_import.rs`** — `.avt` story import in two streaming passes. `avt_read_light` returns the
  JSON with every `imageData` stripped, JS parses that and runs the normal import (id remapping,
  ordering and foreign keys stay in TypeScript where they are tested), then `avt_import_images`
  re-reads the file and streams each base64 payload straight into SQLite. Peak memory is one image
  regardless of file size.
- **`db.rs`** — where the live database is and how to open a writable pool to it. The one place
  that knows the filename and the busy_timeout; close what it hands back.
- **`db_tx.rs`** — the `db_transaction` command: a batch of statements on one connection, which is
  the only place a frontend transaction can come from (see the bullet above).
- **`migration_patch.rs`** — patches `sqlx`'s stored migration checksums (see
  [Database and Migrations](#database-and-migrations)).
- **`sync/`** — the LAN sync server (`start_sync_server`, `sync_connect`, `sync_pull_story`,
  `sync_push_story`, …), paired via QR code.

`db.rs` (for `avt_import.rs`, `db_tx.rs` and `backup.rs`) and `migration_patch.rs` (via the
`lib.rs` setup hook) open `sqlite:aventura.db` under Tauri's **app config dir** — see the
migrations section for why that is not the app data dir. `sync/` never touches the database directly; it moves stories over the
`tauri-plugin-sql` connection on the JS side.

## Settings Migrations

Settings are persisted as one JSON blob, and nothing removes legacy keys from it. Reshaping runs on
the way from disk into the store, in `src/lib/stores/settingsMigrations.ts` — kept out of the rune
store precisely so it can be tested. A rename goes through here too: `recentEntriesForRetrieval`
became `recentEntriesForSuggestions`, because it named the one thing it does not drive — neither
retrieval service ever read it, `SuggestionsService` is its only consumer, and the slider was
already labelled "Plot Suggestions". Two properties every migration there must hold:

- **Idempotent**, because it runs on every load, not just the first after an upgrade. A migration
  that keeps firing silently reverts whatever the user changed in between.
- **Silent about untouched values**, because a stored value equal to the old default was never a
  choice, and carrying it across pins everyone who never opened the panel to a stale number.
