## Data Model

The story is an append-only list of `StoryEntry` rows (`user_action`, `narration`, `system`,
`retry`), each carrying a `position` and a `branchId`. Almost everything else hangs off that list:

- **Branches** fork at a `forkEntryId`. `story.entries` is the current branch's view, assembled
  from the branch's own rows plus everything inherited from its ancestors; `visibleEntries` is
  that list minus what has been folded into chapters.
- **Entry numbers** are what a reader sees and types: `position + 1`, every entry type counted,
  so the last entry's number equals the branch's entry count. Numbering is per branch view — a
  branch continues its parent's positions from the fork, so shared history keeps its numbers and
  sibling branches reuse them after the fork. `resolveEntryByNumber` (`utils/storyNavigation.ts`)
  floors to the nearest lower entry, which is what makes a gap left by an import or a repair
  navigable rather than a dead number.
- **Chapters** cover a contiguous run of entries (`startEntryId`/`endEntryId`) and replace them
  in the prompt with a summary. Entries after the last chapter's end are the **un-chapterized
  tail** (`story.getUnchapterizedEntries()`) — the newest material, and the part chapter-oriented
  tools would otherwise be blind to.
- **World state** (`Character`/`Location`/`Item`/`StoryBeat`) is rewritten by the classifier after
  every turn. A lorebook `Entry` carries no live state of its own: the type has `state` fields
  per entry type, but every creation path initialised them blank and nothing ever wrote one
  (0 of 16 character entries on a measured 41-chapter save), so the four Tier 1 conditions that
  read them never fired and are gone. Presence is `WorldStateInjector`'s claim to make. The
  never-produced `mentionCount`/`firstMentioned`/`lastMentioned` are gone from the model too;
  their columns stay, with their defaults. It is _not_ the Lorebook: `Entry[]` records are
  authored lore that changes only when someone edits them. The two pools never overlap, and
  two different services inject them.

  **A rendered entity line must never be re-readable as a name.** The classifier is shown
  the entities that already exist and writes names back, so `- Eira (claimed as a consort)
[inactive]` came back as the name, missed `sameEntityName`, and created a second
  character — four of thirty-eight on a measured 41-chapter save, two carrying the
  subject's own `relationship` verbatim. Name and attributes are now separate lines
  (`relationship:`, `status:`, `appearance:`), in every list `ClassifierService` renders —
  characters, locations, items, story beats — and in `WorldStateInjector`'s narrator block,
  whose prose the classifier also reads. One name per line also holds names a
  comma-separated list could not: locations and items were CSV until they carried state.

  **State reaches the classifier only where it can act on it.** `appearance:` goes with a
  character in the scene, `description:` with the current location, and an item's
  `quantity`/`equipped`/`location` only when they differ from the default — because each of
  those is a whole-value replacement, and a model cannot rewrite what it was not shown. The
  same rule sizes the prompt: on a large cast the omitted halves are most of it.

  **`scene.currentLocationName` is the only thing that moves the scene.** It creates the
  location if the name is new, marks it `current` and `visited`, and clears the previous
  one. `locationUpdates.changes.current` and `newLocations[].current` did the same job from
  two other places, applied in an order the model could not see, so a response naming two
  places kept whichever ran last — and the merge path set a second `current` without
  clearing the first. Both are gone from the schema.

  **Presence is reported, departure is inferred.** The classifier answers one question about the
  cast — `scene.presentCharacterNames`, every _other_ character in the scene at the end of the
  passage; the protagonist is in every scene by definition and is added by the consumers — and
  `resolveCharacterPresence` (`services/generation/characterPresence.ts`) turns the complement into
  `inactive`. Asking a model to name thirty absent characters produces nothing; asking it to name
  the three in front of it is the question the passage answers. The inference is refused whenever
  the list carries no signal: a salvaged or failed classification, or an empty array — which the
  schema defaults, so "the model said nobody" and "the model did not answer" arrive identically.
  `characterUpdates.status` stays for what the scene states outright, `deceased` above all, and
  wins over the inference. `appearance:` is sent to the classifier only for characters in the
  scene, and the template forbids rewriting an appearance it was not shown, so a returning
  character keeps the descriptors it accumulated.

- **`worldStateDelta`** on an entry records what its classification changed, which is what makes
  retry, time-travel delete and regenerate reversible (`rollbackService`).
- **Checkpoints** are full state snapshots; **retry backups** are in-memory only and do not
  survive an app restart or a story switch. A checkpoint is anchored to its `lastEntryId` and is
  deleted with that entry - in the same transaction, alongside the chapters and embedded images
  that reference it. It is the fork point a branch would be created from, so an orphaned one
  yields a branch pointing at an entry the database no longer holds. A retry backup is scoped to
  a **branch** as well as a story: it records the branch it was taken on, is offered only there,
  and is refused on any other. Positions are reused by sibling branches after a fork, so a
  snapshot applied to the wrong branch deletes rows that merely share a number - and the
  world-state restore deletes the active branch's rows and re-inserts only those of the
  snapshot's that belong to that branch — the delete is branch-scoped, so the insert must be,
  or a snapshot resolved through the lineage carries ancestor rows the delete never removed and
  collides with them on the primary key. The per-branch entity queries match `branch_id` exactly and never fall back
  to inherited rows, so that leaves the active branch with none of its own whatever the
  experimental settings say - main included, when the snapshot came from a branch. Lightweight
  branches only decide how total it is: a pre-snapshot COW branch still resolves its ancestors'
  entities, while snapshot isolation and the legacy per-branch load both leave the panels empty.
- **Removing an entry a branch forks from is refused**, and the check runs before anything else
  the operation would rewind - a rollback, or the lorebook activation a retry restores - because
  a refusal raised afterwards would leave that half applied. Editing and deleting are refused the
  same way while a generation or a retry restore is running: the store throws, and the caller is
  expected to say so rather than treat the untouched story as a completed edit. **Switching
  branches is refused on the same grounds**, for as long as a generation holds the branch.

## Generation Pipeline

A narrator turn is a sequence of phases under `src/lib/services/generation/phases/`, each an async
generator that yields typed events and returns a result. Dependencies are injected, which is what makes
them testable without a provider.

`Retrieval → Narrative → Classification → Translation → Image / BackgroundImage → PostGeneration`, with
`PreGeneration` preparing the retry backup first.

Only the narrative phase is fatal on failure — there is no turn without a narration. Every other phase
degrades: a failed classification leaves world state untouched, a failed translation keeps the original
text, failed images leave the entry without one.

`RetrievalPhase` runs in two stages on purpose. Stage A (world state + lorebook selection) must finish
before stage B (memory retrieval), because the memory step is told what the narrator's prompt already
contains, and a _partial_ list of that is worse than none — it is read as a statement, so naming half of
it invites work on the other half.

Phases are wired by `GenerationPipeline`, but the dependency objects are built in
`src/lib/components/story/ActionInput.svelte` (`buildPipelineDependencies`). That is where the
store, the settings and `aiService` are bound together; the phases themselves import none of them,
which is what keeps them testable.

Alongside the pipeline, `BackgroundTaskRunner` handles what happens _after_ a turn — the chapter
threshold check, lore management and the style review — on its own dependency object.

### The generation lease

A generation is bound to the branch it started on, by a lease the initiating handler takes before
its first read or write and gives up after its last one. There are four such handlers, all in
`ActionInput.svelte`: `handleSubmit`, `handleRetryLastMessage`, `handleRegenerateNarration` and
`handleRetry`. `generateResponse` takes the lease as a required parameter, so a fifth cannot be
added without acquiring one.

The lease and a branch switch are mutually exclusive in both directions: acquiring is refused while
a switch is queued but unsettled, and `performBranchSwitch` refuses while a lease is held. That
second check sits inside the queued body rather than at `switchBranch`'s entrance, because a switch
accepted while idle reaches the front of the queue _after_ a generation may have begun.

Two moments are distinct. **Drained** is when the turn's own writes have settled; **finished**
is when a rewind deferred by Stop has run too, and only then is the branch given up.

The lease does **not** cover the post-turn background tasks — chapter creation and lore
management are started un-awaited and outlive it. Lore management refuses a write whose branch
has moved (`loreCallbacks.assertScope`); chapter creation does not, so a chapter finished after
a switch takes its number from the branch now loaded. The row still carries the right branch,
so this is a numbering fault rather than a misplaced chapter. Stop registers
its rewind on the lease and waits for it rather than releasing — aborting the request to the model
is not the completion of the generation's writes, and an `applyClassificationResult` already entered
keeps going regardless. One release owner throughout, so the rewind cannot race the writes it
exists to reverse.

**Why the switch is refused rather than the writes redirected.** `applyClassificationResult` reads
the active branch and mutates the in-memory `characters`/`locations`/`items`/`storyBeats` arrays,
which hold _that_ branch's view. Pointing it at another branch means decoupling "the branch being
written" from "the branch loaded in memory" — an architectural change, not a parameter. Redirecting
only the entries would be worse than redirecting nothing: the narration would land on the branch
that asked for it while the classification accounting for it did not, leaving that branch holding an
entry its world state does not know about.

**When the restriction can be lifted.** Once world-state application takes the branch to write to as
an argument instead of reading the active one, **and** `addEntry` redirects to the bound branch
rather than asserting against it. Both, not either — the entry half alone produces exactly the
mismatch described above. Branch-scoping `isGenerating`, so Stop and the streaming placeholder
follow the generating branch, belongs to that work too; while the restriction stands the reader
cannot reach another branch to see them. `addEntry`'s assertion is the tripwire in the meantime: if
the exclusion is ever holed, a write lands as a thrown error rather than as a row on the wrong
branch.

### Activity reporting

A turn records what it is doing as a tree of timed steps, so the wait before the first token is
readable rather than a three-dot animation. `services/activity/` holds the record and the reading
views over it — nesting, the deepest running step, durations, retention — all plain TypeScript;
`stores/activity.svelte.ts` is the reactive shell.

The phases reach it through an `ActivityReporter` on `PipelineDependencies`, bound in
`buildPipelineDependencies` alongside everything else. They do not import the store: that is the same
rule that keeps them testable without a provider, and `NO_ACTIVITY` stands in wherever no reporter was
injected. Services under `services/ai/` write to the store directly instead, following the debug
store's precedent — their tests mock it the same way.

Nesting is by explicit parent id, threaded through the options objects that already reach those
services (`activityParentId`). An implicit stack would not survive Stage A's two concurrent branches
or the parallel post-narrative phases.

Retrieval reports through the record it already keeps: `retrievalSteps.ts` translates `RetrievalEvent`
into steps as `AgenticRetrievalService` records them, and chapter queries carry the `durationMs` the
budget already measured. Phases with several completion paths are wrapped by `trackPhase` rather than
instrumented one exit at a time.

Reporting never alters a turn. Every write is guarded, the display sits inside a boundary, and the
narrative retry loop is reported but unchanged. Records are session-only, bounded by `RETAINED_TURNS`,
and never persisted or exported.

`activityReporting` defaults to `line`, so an install that has never touched the setting reports the
running step rather than the ellipsis. `activity_reporting` is written only by `setActivityReporting`
and the interface reset, so a stored `off` is a choice and is read back as one — the default reaches
absent keys only.

## Images

Nine backends live under `src/lib/services/ai/image/providers/` — NanoGPT, OpenAI, OpenRouter,
Google, Chutes, Zhipu, Pollinations, plus local ComfyUI (workflow-based) and A1111.

Resolution is chosen as an **intent** — orientation (1:1 / 16:9 / 9:16) plus one of four size
steps — and each adapter turns it into what its backend accepts: an aspect ratio for Google and
OpenRouter, the model's own published resolution list for NanoGPT, real dimensions for
ComfyUI/A1111/Pollinations (`src/lib/utils/image.ts`). A backend that is handed pixel dimensions
it does not offer answers with the nearest thing it does, which is not the same picture.

Images are stored as base64 in SQLite. Export and import of a story with images (`.avt`) is
handled natively in Rust so the payloads never enter the WebView heap — see
[persistence.md](persistence.md).

## Environment

There are no required `.env` files for local development or the built app:

- `import.meta.env.DEV` is set automatically by Vite and only gates debug logging
  (`src/lib/log.ts`) — nothing to configure.
- **API Keys**: for AI providers, configured at runtime via the UI (Settings -> API Settings), not via
  environment variables.
- Android builds read `ANDROID_HOME` (or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`), `NDK_HOME`, and `JAVA_HOME` from the shell
  environment. `scripts/android-setup.sh` and `compileApk.sh` will auto-detect these from common install
  locations if unset.
